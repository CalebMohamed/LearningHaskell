-- In Haskell, due to its cool features we can implement polymorphism on a much higher level than in other languages
-- we don't have to think about complex type hierachies but simly have to consider what a type can 'act like' and then make it derive the corresponding typeclasses.

-- because we can know so much about a function with its type declaration, typeclasses can be so elegantly defined with abstract function just declaring their type declarations.

-- as we talked about in typeclasses, functors are types that can be mapped over.
